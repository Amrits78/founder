    <h1>🚨 99% of Startups Fail—Don’t Let Yours Be One of Them! 🚨</h1>

    <p>If you’re an aspiring founder, you’ve likely poured your heart, soul, and savings into your dream. You’ve got a brilliant idea, a motivated team, and the passion to change the world. But here’s the harsh truth: without Product-Market Fit (PMF), you’re setting yourself up for failure.</p>

    <h2>💔 Why Do 99% of Startups Fail?</h2>
    <p>The shocking reality is that almost every startup collapses because they skip this critical step. Product-Market Fit is the lifeblood of your business; it’s the moment when your product resonates perfectly with your target audience. No PMF? No survival. It’s that simple.</p>

    <p>You could have the most innovative solution, but if it doesn’t meet the needs of your customers, it’s just an idea. Every minute spent without PMF is a step closer to your dream becoming a distant memory.</p>

    <h3>Here’s the undeniable truth:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customers Don’t Care:</strong> You might think your product is amazing, but if it doesn’t solve a real problem for real people, it won’t sell.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding Won’t Save You:</strong> Investors want to see traction. Without PMF, your runway will evaporate faster than you can say “pivot.”</li>
        <li><strong>The Competition Is Fierce:</strong> In a world full of startups, you need that edge. Without PMF, you’ll blend into the crowd, and your dream will fade.</li>
    </ul>
